# Learning path for React JS

## Description

React is a popular, high-performance JavaScript library for building rapidly responsive user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.Redux is a state management tool. While it's mostly used with React, it can be used with any other JavaScript framework or library.
